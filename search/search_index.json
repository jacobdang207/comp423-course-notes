Enabling dependency tracking for Go","text":"<p>Before writing any code, you should initialize a <code>go.mod</code> file in your project's root directory. The <code>go.mod</code> file defines the Go module your code will be in, and tracks all the other modules your program uses. To make the file you can use the following command: <pre><code>go mod init github.com/&lt;your-username&gt;/go-container\n</code></pre> Be sure to replace <code>&lt;your-username&gt;</code> with your GitHub username. This command initializes the <code>go.mod</code> file, and names the module <code>github.com/&lt;your-username&gt;/go-container.</code> </p> <p>Notes</p> <p>It is best practice to name your module after where it's source code is located, which in our case is our GitHub repository.
